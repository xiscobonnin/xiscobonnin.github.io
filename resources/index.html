These datasets were recorded around a building at the <a href="http://www.uib.es">University of the Balearic Islands</a> and can be used to assess the quality of visual loop closure or SLAM algorithms. See <a href="/static/papers/techrepA042013_Garcia2013.pdf">this paper</a> for further details.<br>

Each file contains:
<ul>
	<li>A directory called <em>images</em>. This directory includes an ordered sequence of images in PNG format. The size of the images is 300x240 and they were acquired at 1Hz.</li><br>
	<li>A ground truth file in Matlab format, <em>groundtruth.mat</em>. This file includes a binary matrix where entry (<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>) is 1 if image <em>i</em> and image <em>j</em> can be considered as the same place, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the <em>i</em>-th row represents the possible loop closures for image <em>i</em>. This ground truth was generated manually, and perhaps it should be modified if you want to use it as a reference.</li>
