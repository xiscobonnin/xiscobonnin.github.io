<h4>INCASS - Inspection Capabilities for Enhanced Ship Safety</h4>
<p><strong>2013-2016</strong></p>
<p class="text-justify">
In the day-to-day ship operations, structural and machinery failures may lead to major accidents, endangering crew and passengers lives onboard, posing a threat to the environment, damaging the ship itself and having a great impact in terms of business losses. Moreover, with the introduction and building of a big number of new ships, their monitoring and inspection from both regulatory bodies and Classification Societies has become more and more difficult in order to obtain the optimum inspection results and eliminating the hazards pose by high-risks and sub-standard ships. In this respect, the INCASS (Inspection Capabilities for Enhanced Ship Safety) project brings together a range of experienced and dedicated partners in order to tackle the issue of ship inspection, identification of high-risk ships, providing access to information related to ship surveys independent of the ship's flag and inspection regime and moreover incorporate enhanced and harmonised cooperation and maritime stakeholders in order to avoid ship accidents, promote maritime safety and protect the environment. The INCASS consortium aims to bring an innovative solution to the ship inspection regime through the introduction of enhanced inspection of ship structures based on robotic platforms, providing ship structures and machinery monitoring with real time information using 'intelligent' sensors and incorporate Structural and Machinery Risk Analysis. Moreover, by introducing Condition Based Inspection tools and methodologies, reliability and critically based maintenance, providing an enhanced Central Database including ship structures and machinery available to maritime authorities (e.g. EMSA, Port State Control), Classification Societies and ship operators and eventually by developing a Decision Support System for ship structures and machinery for continuous monitoring and risk analysis and management of ship operations.

<h4>MINOAS - Marine Inspection Robotic Assistant Systems</h4>
<p><strong>2009-2012</strong></p>
<p class="text-justify">
The increasing competitiveness in marine operations creates a need for new system concepts that introduce high technology value added products, facilitate the processes involved and minimize the downtimes. The need, thus, lies not only in incorporating the technological means so far available, but in changing the way the corresponding authorities stand against the challenges at hand.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
MINOAS project proposes reengineering of the overall vessel-inspection methodology, by introducing an innovative system concept that incorporates state of the art technologies, but at the same time formulates a new standardization of the overall inspection process. Through holistic approach, MINOAS proposes the development of a new infrastructure that substitutes human personnel by high locomotion enabled robots and "teleports" the human inspector from the vessel's hold to a control room with virtual reality properties. The human's perceptual abilities are enhanced through the utilization of high resolution tools (eg. sensors) and are augmented through the parallel processing property provided by MINOAS. Following the centralized control scheme adopted in similar distributed control methodologies (SCADA), the number and the sequence of the tasks required is rearranged and the overall inspection procedure is brought in alignment with the current tendency adopted in similar inspection, exploration and surveillance tasks.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
The proposed innovative system concept, considers the assembly of a robot fleet with advanced locomotion abilities and sets of tools that are dedicated to the tasks attached to the inspection process, the development of control techniques and algorithms that provide a semi-autonomous nature to the operation of the robot-fleet and a hierarchical controller that realize the virtual environment for the human inspector and adds newly developed toolboxes enabling on-line processing of the harvested data and operate as a Decision Support System in the aid of the inspector.

<h4>SHARE-it - Supported Human Autonomy for Recovery and Enhancement of cognitive and motor abilities using information technologies</h4>
<p><strong>2007-2010</strong></p>
<p class="text-justify">
The goal of SHARE-it is to develop a scalable, adaptive system of add-ons to sensor and assistive technology so that they can be modularly integrated into an intelligent home environment to enhance the individualâ€™s autonomy. The system will be designed to inform and assist the user and his/her caregivers through monitoring and mobility help.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
 Thus, we plan to contribute to the development of the next generation of assistive devices for older persons or people with disabilities so that they can be self-dependent as long as possible. We focus on add-ons to be compatible with existing technologies and to achieve an easier integration into existing systems. We also aim at adaptive systems as transparent, and consequently, easy to use to the person as possible. Scalability is meant to include or remove devices from the system in a simple, intuitive way.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
SHARE-it will address important issues in sensor networks, assisted mobility, knowledge engineering and Ambient Intelligence. In this context SHARE-it will make significant contributions to fundamental, long-term research in the following areas:
</p>

<ul>
<li>C1: Sensor-based environment perception, knowledge acquisition and representation, high-level reasoning and goal seeking behaviours in a real world (preferred environment).</li>
<li>C2: Verifying software adaptation to human with special needs: both at design and run-time - as operating conditions and governing norms change - to establish (e.g.) safety, regulatory and security requirements.</li>
<li>C3: Incorporating shared autonomy: ensuring individual software components and groups of software components can be designed to operate in a given intelligent ambiance and adapt to possible changes both in the needs of the user or in the environment.</li>
</ul> 

<p class="text-justify">
The objectives of SHARE-it are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>O1: To explore the benefits of the concept of situated intelligence to build elements (add-ons) that will enhance the autonomy of the target user group in their daily life in their preferred environment.</li>
<li>O2: To investigate and implement innovative forms of shared autonomy.</li>
<li>O3: To build appropriate add-ons to standardised technologies to provide ubiquitous sensing, computation and assistance</li>
<li>O4: To build adaptive interfaces for the target group.</li>
<li>O5: To target the various human-delivered assistance and caretaking services as effectively as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-justify">
The consortium includes 1 major industrial partner, 3 Universities, 2 research Institutes and 2 Health Care institutions.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
The overall project work is intended to bring together existing work from a number of areas and make a concerted effort to develop a sound paradigm for future development of mission critical systems for individuals suffering disabilities involving automated components: creating important reference points in the field, aiming to catalyse debate and opening future research directions.
